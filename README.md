## Examples

#### Starting a flow

```erlang
ok = application:start(swirl),

FlowMod = swirl_flow_example,
FlowOpts = [
    {stream_names, [delivery]},
    {stream_filter, "exchange_id = 3 AND bidder_id IS NOT NULL"}
],
MapperNodes = [node()],
ReducerNode = node(),
{ok, Flow} = swirl_flow:start(FlowMod, FlowOpts, MapperNodes, ReducerNode),

swirl_stream:emit(delivery, #{exchange_id => 1, bidder_id => 10}),

ok = swirl_flow:stop(Flow)
```

#### Implementing a flow

```erlang
-module(swirl_flow_example).
-include_lib("swirl/include/swirl.hrl").

-behavior(swirl_flow).
-export([
    map/3,
    reduce/3,
    output/4
]).

%% swirl_flow callbacks
map(StreamName, Event, _MapperOpts) ->
    Type = ?LM(type, Event),
    ExchangeId = ?LM(exchange_id, Event),
    BidderId = ?LM(bidder_id, Event),

    Key = {Type, StreamName, ExchangeId, BidderId},
    CounterIncrements = {1, 10},

    {Key, CounterIncrements}.

reduce(_Flow, Row, _ReducerOpts) ->
    Row.

output(_Flow, _Period, Rows, OutputOpts) ->
    %% do something with the output
    io:format("rows: ~p~n", [Rows]),
```

#### Stream Filters

```erlang

exchange_id = 3 AND bidder_id IS NOT NULL
flight_id in (10, 12, 23) OR tag_id = 20
buyer_id notnull AND seller_id > 103
```
## Swirl QL
